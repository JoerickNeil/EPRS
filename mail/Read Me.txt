1)open php.ini(xampp)
find mail function
Edit or comment out all in mail function

2)inside the mailfunction insert this command
sendmail_path ="C:\xampp\sendmail\sendmail.exe -t -i"

3)get or unpack send mail from zip/rar
after this put the send email folder in xampp folder and make sure libeay32.dll, sendmail.ini, ssleay32.dll and sendmail.exe is in the folder


after this hope that it works though it works for me. It wont be 100% sure it will work on others as there are many factor in the bug
